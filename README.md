There is an issue with the OMDB website, Ã—"We are going private!05/10/17 - New API Keys! Due to some security concerns on how the keys were being distributed I updated the form to email them and also changed the algorithm used, which means your older keys not obtained through email will eventually stop working.

So it was suggest by other people to use this site. Just sign up and you
get an API key and the tutorial is very similar.
